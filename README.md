# WallperViewer

An online viewer for the [Wallper](https://www.wallper.app/) live wallpapers catalog.
Preview and download the videos in their original resolution without using the Wallper app.

## Motivation

Their catalog is a great starting point for discovering video wallpapers, which is why I wanted to be able to browse it on other platforms, such as Linux, and use it with different tools.

On macOS, I also noticed significant CPU usage with Wallper, which eventually led me to switch to [LiveWallpaperMacOS](https://github.com/thusvill/LiveWallpaperMacOS).

This web application lets me discover new wallpapers independently of Wallper, while still taking advantage of third-party software.
